# Deis Postgres v2

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to provide a lightweight, easy and secure way to deploy your code to production.

For more information about the Deis workflow, please visit the main project page at https://github.com/deis/workflow.

## Beta Status

This Deis component is currently in beta status, and we welcome your input! If you have feedback, please submit an [issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and submit a [pull request][prs].

# About

This component is a PostgreSQL database for use in Kubernetes. It builds on the official [postgres](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) Docker image. While it's intended for use inside of the Deis open source [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), it's flexible enough to be used as a standalone pod on any Kubernetes cluster or even as a standlone Docker container.

# Development

The Deis project welcomes contributions from all developers. The high level process for development matches many other open source projects. See below for an outline.

- Fork this repository
- Make your changes
- Submit a [pull request][prs] (PR) to this repository with your changes, and unit tests whenever possible.
- If your PR fixes any [issues][issues], make sure you write Fixes #1234 in your PR description (where #1234 is the number of the issue you're closing)
- The Deis core contributors will review your code. After each of them sign off on your code, they'll label your PR with LGTM1 and LGTM2 (respectively). Once that happens, you may merge.

## Prerequisites

In order to develop and test this component in a Deis cluster, you'll need the following:

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, configured and running
* A working Kubernetes cluster and `kubectl` installed and configured to talk to the cluster
	* If you don't have this setup, please see [the installation instructions][install-k8s]

## Testing Your Code

Once you have all the aforementioned prerequisites, you can build and (optionally) push a new Docker image with your changes.

This project has a [Makefile](https://github.com/deis/postgres/blob/master/Makefile) that makes these tasks significantly easier. It requires the following environment variables to be set:

* `DEIS_REGISTRY` - A Docker registry that you have push access to and your Kubernetes cluster can pull from
  * If this is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), leave this variable empty
  * Otherwise, ensure it has a trailing `/`. For example, if you're using [Quay.io](https://quay.io), use `quay.io/`
* `IMAGE_PREFIX` - The organization in the Docker repository. This defaults to `deis`, but if you don't have access to that organization, set this to one you have push access to.
* `SHORT_NAME` (optional) - The name of the image. This defaults to `controller`
* `VERSION` (optional) - The tag of the Docker image. This defaults to the current Git SHA (the output of `git rev-parse --short HEAD`)

Assuming you have these variables set correctly, run `make docker-build` to build the new image, and `make docker-push` to push it. Here is an example command that would push to `quay.io/arschles/postgres:devel`:

```console
export DEIS_REGISTRY=quay.io/
export IMAGE_PREFIX=arschles
export VERSION=devel
make docker-build docker-push
```

Note that you'll have to push your image to a Docker repository (`make docker-push`) in order for your Kubernetes cluster to pull the image. This is important for testing in your cluster.
