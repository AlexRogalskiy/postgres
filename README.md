# Postgres

A PostgreSQL database for use in the [Deis](http://deis.io) open source PaaS.

This Docker image is based on the official
[postgres](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) image.

Master/slave replication and leader election code is largely inspired by [`compose/governor`](https://github.com/compose/governor).

Please add any [issues](https://github.com/deis/postgres/issues) you find with this software.


## Deploying

To build a dev release of this image, you will also need your own registry, but DockerHub or
[Quay](https://quay.io/) will do fine here. To build, run:

```bash
$ export DEIS_REGISTRY=myregistry.com:5000
$ make docker-build docker-push
```

This will compile the Docker image and push it to your registry.

After that, run

```
$ make deploy
```

Which will deploy the component to kubernetes. After a while, you should see one pod up with one
running:

```
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
deis-database-6wy8o   1/1       Running   0          32s
```

You can then query this pod as you would with any other Kubernetes pod:

```
$ kubectl logs -f deis-database-6wy8o
$ kubectl exec -it deis-database-6wy8o psql
```


## Testing

You can run the test suite with

```
$ make test
```
