# Deis Postgres v2

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds on [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) to provide a lightweight, easy and secure way to deploy your code to production.

For more information about the Deis workflow, please visit the main project page at https://github.com/deis/workflow.

## Beta Status

This Deis component is currently in beta status, and we welcome your input! If you have feedback, please submit an [issue][issues]. If you'd like to participate in development, please read the "Development" section below and submit a [pull request][prs].

# About

This component is a PostgreSQL database for use in Kubernetes. It builds on the official [postgres](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) Docker image. While it's intended for use inside of the Deis open source [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), it's flexible enough to be used as a standlone pod on any Kubernetes cluster.

## Deploying

To build a dev release of this image, you will also need your own registry, but DockerHub or
[Quay](https://quay.io/) will do fine here. To build, run:

```bash
$ export DEIS_REGISTRY=myregistry.com:5000
$ make docker-build docker-push
```

This will compile the Docker image and push it to your registry.

After that, run

```
$ make deploy
```

Which will deploy the component to kubernetes. After a while, you should see one pod up with one
running:

```
NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-6wy8o        1/1       Running   0          32s
```

You can then query this pod as you would with any other Kubernetes pod:

```
$ kubectl logs -f postgres-6wy8o
$ kubectl exec -it postgres-6wy8o psql
```


## Testing

You can run the test suite with

```
$ make test
```
